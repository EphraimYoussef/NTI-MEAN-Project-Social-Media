# POSTLY MEAN-Stack Project

## Overview

This is a full-stack simple social media application built using the **MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)**. The platform allows users to create posts, like and comment on posts, and manage their content. It also includes route guards to protect authenticated and unauthenticated routes, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.
